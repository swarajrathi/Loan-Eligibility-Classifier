# Loan-Eligibility-Classifier
With the tremendous development in the banking sector, financial companies and banking firms are handling a heavy crowd in applications for loans. Since these banks and firms have financial constraints the loans can only be granted to limited customers. So for finding out to whom the loans could be granted, loan approval is a very essential procedure. Getting the loan repaid by the customer is a major parameter and to find out which customer would be a safer option for granting a loan, mining of data of previous banking history and accounts of the customer for whom the loan was approved is done and based on this data the machine is trained by the machine learning models. In this project, four machine learning models, Logistic Regression, The Decision Tree, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and The Random Forest Classifier have been implemented for deciding whether granting a loan to a customer would be safer or not. The results show that the Logistic Regression model stands more accurate as compared to others.
